Thank you very, very much for reviewing my project! Have a great day! :)

This repository is Paula Segura's submission for the "Getting and Cleaning Data
Course Project". It contrains the instructions on the Human Activity Recognition 
Using Smartphones Dataset (Version 1.0)
The used data set's authorship is of Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto.

Dataset used
============
	http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The dataset contains the following files: 
=========================================
- "README.txt" 
	
- "CodeBook.txt" 
	Code book that describes the variables, data, modifications and transformations of the data, in order 
	to clean up the data. 

-"run.analysis.R" 
	Preforms the setting up of the data and the steps described in the course project: 
		"1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
		 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
		 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
		 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
		 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject."

- "WantedData.txt" 
	The exported final version of the data, after completing the guidelines given in the course project.
